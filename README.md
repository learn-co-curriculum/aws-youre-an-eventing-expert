# You're an Eventing Expert Now!

## Reflect

Remember our "Simple Liker" program? In it we saw that front-end web programming
is using three "pillars" working together:

- ☑ Manipulating the DOM
- ☑ Recognizing JavaScript events
- Communicating with the server

Now that you've conquered this section, you've learned all the fundamentals of
the second pillar, recognizing JavaScript events. You used JavaScript events to
invoke actions, created JavaScript functions and implemented event listeners.

## Next Step

Two pillars down, one to go. You're more than halfway to being able to make your
own web applications. Next let's take what we've learned about the DOM and
eventing and put it together with server communciation.
